Managing Sensitivity Labels
---------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Creating Excel documents is a common requirement in various data analysis and reporting tasks. Libraries such as ``openpyxl`` and the ``DataFrame.to_excel`` method from ``pandas`` are powerful tools for these purposes, offering robust support for manipulating data within Excel files. However, one critical feature often required in professional environments—managing Sensitivity Labels—is not directly supported by these libraries.

Sensitivity Labels are used within many organizations to classify and protect data according to its sensitivity level. These labels can dictate who can access the document and how it can be shared, both critical aspects of data security and compliance.

The Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To address this gap, I've developed a set of classes and methods that extend the functionality of existing Python libraries to support Sensitivity Labels in Excel documents. This enhancement leverages the ``pywin32`` library, a powerful tool that facilitates interaction between applications using the Windows Component Object Model (COM) and .NET architecture.

While this solution is somewhat machine-dependent—requiring Windows and the presence of the Microsoft Office suite—it currently stands as the most viable option for integrating Sensitivity Label management into Python-based Excel document workflows.

How It Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The integration with ``pywin32`` allows Python scripts to directly manipulate Office documents, including setting and retrieving Sensitivity Labels, by interacting with the Office applications themselves. This approach provides a seamless bridge between Python's data manipulation capabilities and Office's document security features.

Getting Started with Demos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To showcase the capabilities of this toolkit, I've prepared a couple of demos. These Python scripts demonstrate how to apply Sensitivity Labels to Excel and Word documents programmatically, offering a practical guide to using these features in your projects.

- **Excel Sensitivity Manager**: ``demo_excel_sensitivity_manager.py``
- **Word Sensitivity Manager**: ``demo_word_sensitivity_manager.py``

Each demo script contains step-by-step instructions on setting up your environment, running the demo, and integrating similar functionality into your own projects. Whether you're generating reports, sharing data analysis results, or creating documentation, these tools can help ensure your documents meet your organization's security and compliance standards.

Future Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the current solution meets the basic needs for Sensitivity Label management, ongoing work aims to refine these tools, exploring alternative approaches that may offer broader compatibility and reduced dependencies. Feedback and contributions are warmly welcomed to help evolve this toolkit to better serve the community's needs.
